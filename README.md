# Summary
Some of my study projects: 

- [Energy consumption forecast with RNN](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/load-forecast) - My monography developed to acquire the Bachelor title in Production Engineering from UFF. A recurrent neural network model (based on tensorflow) to forecast the energy consumption of the southeast region of Brazil for the 5 next weeks (outputs a sequence). The model was trained on public data from ONS (Operador Nacional do Sistema El√©trico) and proposes a solution to the energy forecasts that ONS demmands weekly from companies operating in energy distribuition. The study develop and compare models trained to forecast 5 next values from a time series in one shot vs forecasting the next value and auto regressively feeding each prediction as a data point for the next prediction.
 
- [Titanic survival prediction model](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/Kaggle_Titanic) - Machine Learning model to predict survivability of Titanic passangers. CI basic structure on yaml file to print performance metrics as comments in pull requests.

- [Time series Regression Model for VLabs Challange](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/vlabs-challenge) - ElasticNet Regressor to predict how much each client is going to spend in the next 90 days based on data from 14 months of purchases. 5 diferent models to predict customer lifetime value by channel of sale. Scored second place in the leaderboard out of 17 teams. (Notebooks in portuguese-BR)

- [Tabular Data Sep21 Analysis- Kaggle competition](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/TPS-sep21) - LightGBM regressor tuned with bayesian optimization (optuna) for the tabular data competition. The dataset has 118 unnamed numeric features and the missing values are significantly relevant for prediction.

- [IDHM prediction of brazilian cities](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/brazilian_cities_IDHM) - Voting regressor of 4 tree-based algorithms to predict de IDHM (Municipal Human Development Index) of brazilian cities

- [Deployed Web App to compare routes on a map](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/plot_route_app) - A Streamlit based deployed web app that plot multiple routes on a map for comparison and geospatial analysis. You can play with the app at: https://share.streamlit.io/marcos-mansur/plot_route_app/main/MyApp.py
 
- [Web Scrapping learning projects](https://github.com/marcos-mansur/WebScrappingProjects) - a robot to download book covers from https://inventwithpython.com/ and another that plays simple instructions and record the board of each play at [2048](https://play2048.co/) with selenium and bs4.
