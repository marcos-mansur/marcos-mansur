Hi! I'm Marcos Mansur, a brazillian production engineering student in love with programming and machine learning!

After 1 year and 8 months of internship in Brands Marketing in a multinational company, I quit to persue a field of knowledge that had been fascinating me for quite some time: Machine Learning! Currently, studying every day to build a solid base for a career in Data Science and related areas.

Strongly problem solving oriented and motivated by challenges and puzzles. Very curious, always learning!
